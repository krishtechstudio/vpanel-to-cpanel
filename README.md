# vPanel 2 cPanel
Wanna have a cPanel experience in vPanel(myownfreehost.net)? You have come to the right place.<br>
THE SCRIPT HAS BEEN UPDATED,AND IFASTNET CAN NO LONGER SUSPEND YOU! 
<hr>
This project uses multiple Open Source Projects of WybeNetwork and a lot of Organizations.<br>
Steps > <br>
1. Go fork my <a href="https://repl.it/@soundarrr/cpanel">repl.</a>(Changing the scripts in iFastnet panel takes a long time, so a small easy alternative).<br>
2. After forking edit script.js, find https://domain.org and replace it with your support system url(A KB or a Discord Server URL).<br>
3. Copy the repl.it deployed URL(e.g https://cpanel.yourusername.repl.co).<br>
4. Login into https://panel.myownfreehost.net and go to customise adverts area(Control Panel Adverts), choose the domain and add,<br>

> Top Advert <br>


```<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cpanel.yourusername.repl.co/script.js"></script>```

> Bottom Advert <br>

`<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://cpanel.yourusername.repl.co/icon_spritemap.css">`  <br>
`<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://cpanel.yourusername.repl.co/styles.css"> `

<hr>
And thats pretty much it, you just got vPanel looking like cPanel.<br>
